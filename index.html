    <p style="font-size: larger;">My name is Neema Ocholla an engineer in training,codeHive 2025 cohort.
        The units that I am learning at the codeHive programming are the following;
        <li style="font-size: larger;">
            <ol>Product Management</ol>
            <ol>Frontend Web Development</ol>
            <ol>Frontend Mobile Development</ol>
            <ol>Backend( mainly python)</ol>
            <ol>Quality Assurance </ol>
            <ol>Navigating Your Journey</ol>
            <ol>Data And Software Architecture</ol>
            <ol>UI/UX Design</ol>
             <ol>UX Research</ol>

        </li>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">All these units are being taught since these are what is occurong in the development of a software product.</p>
    <h2 style="font-size: larger; color: indigo;">Product Management</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">In Product Management we learn how to manage a tech product from the beginning which is identifying the problem so that we can provide the solutions to this problem.It includes giving the visions and goals while laying out the plan on how the developers would work together and bring the solutions.They also check if the tech product has met the requirements of this tech product if it is fulfilled.
        Before the beginning of this class we were shown how to write emails,writing on Google Docs and also using Google sheets.
    </p>
<h2 style="font-size: larger;color:indigo;">Frontend Web  and Mobile Development.</h2>
<p style="font-size: larger;">On the frontend web development we mainly look at making of the websites of several products.So far we have created a website <a href="https://app.netlify.com/sites/neemaexperienceatakirachix/"></a>It was mainly about my first week experience at the institution and currently I am working on another website that is about the sign up and sign in pages.The web is important especially when there is access to the internet but there is no access to the mobile applications.</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> For the frontend mobile development we had started learning about Kotlin an android programming language used for making mobile applications for android.Earlier we had made our GitHub accounts and also some of the terminal and Git commands that we would be using as software engineers.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: larger;color: indigo;">Backend</h2>
<p style="font-size: larger;">Backend is the core of making these software products as they use the languages that give the computer commands to make them.During this lesson we learnt about the different backend languages like Python,Ruby,Java and Swift.These languages are then put into the different frontend frameworks that work in different kind of databaes.Currently we are learning about python and we know of the basic python commands.</p>
